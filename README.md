## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project analyzes customer data to **identify factors contributing to churn** and builds **machine learning models** to predict whether a customer will leave.
